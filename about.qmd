I’m **Carlos Castillo-Passi**, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Radiology at Stanford University. I’m passionate about MRI simulation, GPU computing, and solving optimization problems.

This is a space where I share some projects I’ve been developing. It’s meant to show the fun side of serious science: explanations and cool things I can’t put anywhere else. Too technical for social media and too hand‑wavy for peer review. Some blog posts may complement my publications in the future.
